## Personal
My name is David Hardage. I'm born and raised in Texas. I'm passioante about education and continued growth. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and spending time with my amazing wife and our pets. 

My career has centered around business and data analytics. I am currently in the MS Economics program at Purdue University.

I'm starting this blog as a way to share things I've worked on and learned.
